Description: wolfSSL encryption library
 wolfSSL is a small, portable, embedded SSL/TLS programming library
 targeted for use by embedded systems developers. It was formerly
 known as CyaSSL.
 .
 It is an open source, dual licensed implementation of SSL/TLS
 (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, DTLS 1.0 and 1.2) written in the C
 language.  wolfSSL includes both a client and server implementation,
 progressive cipher support, key and certificate generation, OCSP
 and CRL, access to the underlying cryptography modules, and more.
 .
 wolfSSL also includes an OpenSSL compatibility interface with the
 most commonly used OpenSSL functions.
 .
 wolfSSL is solely provided as an alternative to OpenSSL for
 packages whose licenses are incompatible to Apache 2.0. For details,
